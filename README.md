# EURISKO

NOTE: Due to a bug in Medley's PROP command I had to split out Units into a new file. I'll add them back together when the bug is fixed.

# How to run
1. Install [Medley Interlisp](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley)
2. Open an Interlisp Exec by hold right-clicking on the background and releasing on "Interlisp" in the EXEC sub-menu.
3. Change to the directory where you downloaded EURISKO
```
cd /home/foo/eurisko/
```
4. Load and run
```
(LOAD 'EUR.LCOM)
(Eurisko)
```
Or `(Eurisko 0)` for much less verbose output.
`(PAGEHEIGHT 0)` turns off Medley's page hold so it stops asking you to continue on a full window of text. This resets if you resize the window.

# How to use
I'll get back to you on that one...
